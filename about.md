Hello,<br>
<br>
Greetings of the Day!<br>
<br>
I am a Computer Engineering Student from Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India. <br>
I have been volunteering for a good cause in a Healthcare Technology Project at “Mukono Municipal General Hospital, Uganda”. <br>
I am skilled in Systems Engineering and have won several contests, hackathon and awards. <br>
I was urged by my passion and curiosity for research in Healthcare Technology to Volunteer in the Hospital which leads to better lives of the underprivileged. <br>

Mukono is a small town in Uganda, Africa. Many villages depend on the Municipal Hospital for their healthcare. <br>
The hospital has more than 5000 patients monthly which are treated free of cost. <br>
The health workers, doctors and staff here are working hours and hours to keep records on the books and manage the patients simultaneously. <br>
This is making it hard for them and It is inefficient and time consuming for them, the patients have to wait for long hours.<br>
The project that I am working on, is all about digitising the processes in the OPD and Pathology Lab of the hospital to increase the productivity, provide smooth flow of patients and help manage the increasing number of patients in the Hospital.<Br>
It also involves Data Science applications for Actionable Healthcare Insights which will help them in preparedness and proper medicine delivery. The application is being developed under Government of Uganda and WHO standards. <br>
